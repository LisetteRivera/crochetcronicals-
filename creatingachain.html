  <p><h2>Step One | Slip Knot</h2></p>
<p>When it comes to make a slip knot, you are sort of making a regualr knot. So you need to wrap the yarn around your finger twice (not too tight) then grab that second line under the first one to pull through and ta-da! You have a slip knot!</p>

<p><h2>Step Two | Making The Chain</h2></p>

<p>After creating a slip knot, you then want to go on and put you hook through the lopp you have just created.
