    <p><h1>Let's Make a Chain!</h1></p>
  <p>When it comes to starting a crochet project, we first need to start with a chain!</p>
  <p>But, what is a chain? Glad you asked! A chain is the foundation that we will be basing our project on</p>
  
  <p><h2>Step One | Slip Knot</h2></p>
<p>When it comes to make a slip knot, you are sort of making a regualr knot. So you need to wrap the yarn around your finger twice (not too tight) then grab that second line under the first one to pull through and ta-da! You have a slip knot!</p>

<p><h2>Step Two | Making The Chain</h2></p>
<p>After creating your slip knot, you then want to place your hook into the loop you just made.</p>

<p>After creating a slip knot, you then want to go on and put you hook through the lopp you have just created. Wrap the yarn over the hook, then pull through the loop.</p>
<p>Then repeat as many times as you wish to create your foundation chain!<p/>

<p><h2>Step Three | Getting Ready For The Next Row</h2></p>
<p>Now that we have as many chains as we want, we are now going to create one more change. This will help us be able to make a single crochet much easier!</p>
<p>After we finish creating an extra chain, we are now going to flip our work. Now we are ready to start a single crochet!</p>
